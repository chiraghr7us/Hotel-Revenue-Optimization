# 🏨 Revenue Insights Dashboard - Hospitality Domain

### 📊 Project Overview
**Atliq Grands**, a luxury hotel chain in India, was facing a loss of market share and revenue due to strategic gaps and a lack of data-driven decision-making. This project involved building an end-to-end **Power BI** dashboard to provide the Revenue Management team with actionable insights into pricing, occupancy, and profitability.

### 🔢 Key Metrics & Scope
- **Data Scale:** 134,590 bookings analyzed across 3 months (May-July 2022).
- **Total Revenue Realized:** ₹1.71 Billion.
- **Cancellation Rate:** 24.83%.
- **Cities Covered:** Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore.

### 💡 Critical Insights Delivered
1. **Pricing Strategy:** Identified a "Flat Pricing" inefficiency where weekend RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) was significantly higher than weekdays, yet pricing remained static. Recommended a **Dynamic Pricing** model to capture lost revenue.
2. **Operational Gaps:** Discovered a correlation between low property ratings (avg < 3 stars) and high cancellation rates (~25%) in specific Bangalore properties.
3. **Occupancy Trends:** visualized that while **Delhi** had the highest occupancy (60%+), **Mumbai** contributed the highest overall revenue, suggesting a need to optimize ADR (Average Daily Rate) in Delhi.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Power BI Desktop:** Dashboarding & Visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Calculated complex KPIs (RevPAR, ADR, Realisation %, DSRN).
- **Power Query:** ETL processes to clean and merge 5+ CSV datasets.
- **Data Modeling:** Designed a **Star Schema** connecting Fact tables (Bookings) with Dimensions (Date, Hotel, Rooms).
